0.6.00 -> All new loading process: Collecting all GMLs in a global array instead of recursively create new local arrays per file.
			Removed old overhead code.

0.5.23 -> Removed a bug which looped on loading if you put the wrong gml together.
0.5.22 -> Jumping to start room if room from URL does not exist and printing out a warning in the console.
0.5.21 -> Direct room by URL does work again.
0.5.20 -> It's all working again (hopefully). Sounds not tested yet. Direct URL does not work yet again, though.
0.5.19 -> Brought it to work again, the directory algorithm was messed up.
0.5.18 -> Moved the GML-collector to the parseGML function (again).
0.5.17 -> Copied the collector code to GIMLI structure. Working. Not continuing after load right now.
0.5.16 -> The collector works properly but is not implemented yet.
0.5.15 -> Continued working on the GML collector.
0.5.14 -> Continued working on the GML collector. Implemented it into the startup process for testing.
0.5.13 -> Also moved __jsonUpperCase to behelpers.
0.5.12 -> I already implemented loadJSONFile into behelpers but forgot to change the calls. Removed the double entry function.
0.5.11 -> Began to write the GML collector for better loading process timing.
0.5.10 -> Set the debug output when loading panels to LOG_DEBUG_VERBOSE.
0.5.09 -> unfocus did not work, maybe now.
0.5.08 -> new item command: unfocus -> removes the focus from all items. {item unfocus}
0.5.07 -> item command parameters: item ITEMNAME focus X Y -> set the room position when focusing.
0.5.06 -> hide blocker even if the bg image could not load.
0.5.05 -> item command (item itemname focus) focus: shows mouseover of given item
0.5.04 -> Height bugfix in the panel build process.
0.5.03 -> Buttons ever visible on panels even if the content is bigger. Made two divs for that.
0.5.02 -> "BugFix": jBash.Parse instead of jBash.instance.DoLine on panel-button-click.
0.5.01 -> BugFix, SCRIPT without S in items did not work.
0.5.00 -> Big version change: You need to make the ONCLICK events of all your ITEMS from <5.00 into array-brackets!
			In exchange for that, you can make multible script lines in the ITEMS now, too.

0.4.04 -> Loading SOUND for panel buttons, and it's DELAY.
0.4.03 -> It's SCRIPT/S, not CLICK. I changed it back so it is consistent to the ITEMS.
0.4.02 -> Combining CLICK and ONCLICK in the panels instead of preferring "click".
0.4.01 -> ONCLICK Array instead of single line in the panels.
0.4.00 -> Panels working. With buttons. With jBash-commands. With nice font. In oldschool blue-white.

0.3.25 -> GIMLI.panelActive flag to stop the mouse and scroll action when there is a panel.
0.3.22-0.3.24 -> Made the buttons working, too. But not the clicking itself yet.
0.3.21 -> panel text shown properly without buttons yet. Mouseover and scrolling in the background needs to be canceled.
0.3.20 -> jBash command "panel" to show panels.
0.3.19 -> function to show a specific panel.
0.3.18 -> SHOW command: show sounds, show panels, show items and show rooms prints out the associated array as list.

0.3.16 -> Panels in code.

0.3.14 -> began writing the PANELS code in GML.
0.3.13 -> New jBash command: "sounds" -> show all loaded sounds.
0.3.12 -> Almost completely new scrolling process.
		The old one did not work with the keys, the mouse stopped it all the way and mouseover was not done right.
		When using keydown directly (no interval), it worked someway but very lame.
		Now it uses an interval for both, mouse and keyboard input and the mouseover does also work very well. 
		The mouse does not block the keyboard anymore when it is in the scroll boundaries.

0.3.11 -> mouseover when scrolling with the keys. not really proper code but it almost works, only not when you have the mouse in a scroll area, too.
0.3.10 -> mouseover when scrolling. Only mouse right now, working on the key-mouseover.
0.3.09 -> shorter scroll function.
0.3.08 -> Scrolling with the arrow keys.
0.3.06/07 -> Loglevel display bugfix.
0.3.05 -> set room position with scroll boundaries. (bugfix)
0.3.04 -> set room position from script: "Jump to roomname x y"
0.3.03 -> included bhelpers.js into the system, it was just laying around doing nothing. 
			All functions from there taken out of gimli.js. Included new log functionality.
0.3.02 -> Show blocker message to the verbose log group.
0.3.01 -> Loading screen. Removed diashow window.

0.3.00 -> Use ?roomname in your URL (to index.html, not gml...) for jumping directly into a room. e.G: index.html?floor
			[edit] does not work right because of the loading process.

0.2.10 -> Issuing after load function after load of all recursive loading files which need some time. Hopefully...
0.2.09 -> Mtouchover Bugfix. It will now make a mouseover event after a click properly I hope.
0.2.08 -> New DELAY for items: click the item after this delay, based on the sound length. (1.0 = full, 0.5 = half, etc.)
0.2.07 -> now the sounds play and AFTER that the item click function is done.
0.2.02 -> 0.2.06 : deliberately trying to get the duration of this frikkin sound files...
0.2.01 -> prevent mouseover check if console is on.

0.2.00 -> You can now make a sound bank with the SOUNDS-Array including "INTERN" and "FILE" per sound 
			and play those sounds on click on an item with the "SOUND" tag.

0.1.21 -> Sound call works, sound play not yet.
0.1.20 -> Almost everything preparated for playing sounds, except parseGML in the sound-item and playing it.
0.1.19 -> Loading SOUND (intern name) from GML into item for playing on click.
0.1.18 -> loading SOUNDS from GML into sound array.
0.1.17 -> SOUND structure prototype.

0.1.14 -> added m_CollisionLoaded to the items to determine if mouse check should be done or...not. Not yet functional.
0.1.13 -> can now use (one) ROOMS AND (one) LOCATIONS array per file (instead of "or").
0.1.12 -> use of the __shortenDirectory function for comparing gml file paths for double entries.
0.1.11 -> new function __shortenDirectory(longdir) to remove all "dir/../" combinations from a directory.
0.1.10 -> new jBash command "loglevel" to set or get the actual log level.
0.1.09 -> show warning when the same gml file loads twice. But it does NOT show the warning if the files are accessed from different directories.
			TODO: set up code to make unique directory names. (change e.g. rootdir/my_pre_dir/../my_new_dir to rootdir/my_new_dir)
0.1.05-0.1.08 -> added touch events for supporting mobiles. Not really working but....it's something.
0.1.04 -> can now load gmls from sub-directories. The entries in the gml can be relative. "FOLDER" tag can be omitted.
0.1.03 -> Trying to load GMLs from sub-directories. Not done yet. Upload for working on another computer.
0.1.01 - 0.1.02 -> added and removed a directory fix which aint working.
