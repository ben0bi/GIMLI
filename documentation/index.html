			<h1>What is GIML[i]?</h1>
			<span class="highlight">GIML[i]</span> stands for:<br />
			<br />
			<span class="highlight">G</span>ame
			<span class="highlight">I</span>nduced
			<span class="highlight">M</span>arkup
			<span class="highlight">L</span>anguage

			..and it is only a coincidence that it resembles the name of the great dwarf Gimli from the Lord Of The Rings. But on the other side, there is no such thing as coincidence and so I believe the name is just right because Gimli visited Moria, 
			which resembles the internet of modern times. And do not forget that the books were written at times were there was no computer networks, not even public computers.<br />
			<br />
			GIML[i] shall be the "new" internet, the one you see in like every movie where there is a computer,
			from before the year 2000. After 2000, the "real internet" existed and movies resembled that one
			instead of their own vision of an internet. So, what did you see there?
			Mostly some 3D-animations of futuristic cities, or something, where the user can fly through.
			I did not like that vision but it is more...creative than
			the ad- and cookie-filled internet from today.<br />
			<br />
			Then I watched the TV-series "Halt And Catch Fire" which
			you should watch, too. :) It's setting is in the 1980ties
			until 1990ties. The first season is about building a new home computer. 
			In the second and/or third season, they make a gaming community
			and build their own internet. And that is GIML[i]: 
			It shall resemble the community system from "Halt And Catch Fire":<br />An Adventure-like, 2D, pixelated but very sweet internet browsing system based on images, 
			where the end-user [hopefully] can draw into like a child.
