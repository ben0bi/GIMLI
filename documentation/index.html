<a name="introduction"></a>
<h1>What is GIML[i]? <a href="#top">^</a></h1>
<span class="highlight">GIML[i]</span> stands for:<br />
<br />
<span class="highlight">G</span>ame
<span class="highlight">I</span>nduced
<span class="highlight">M</span>arkup
<span class="highlight">L</span>anguage
[<span class="highlight">i</span>nterpreter]<br />
<br />
So, it is a <span class="highlight">markup language</span> like <span class="highlight">HTML</span>. This JavaScript-interpreter is just a <span class="highlight">prototype</span> to show the functionality of a GIML-page. I would like to have a real GIML-Browser in the end, maybe a fork of the FireFox-Browser which natively understands the GML, so that there has to be no html web page "around" it like now.<br />
<br />
<span class="highlight">Game induced</span> means that there are images and the web page is interactive. It is not only text with some images beneath it, like a page of a book,
but images with images on them which can be interactively used like in a <span class="highlight">point&click-adventure</span> game.<br />
<br />
For that, a GIML-page does not only contain a GML (alike HTML) file but also a file structure with much images put into there.
The GML file does only describe, how and when those images are loaded and placed, and what the items can do when there is a click.<br />
<br />
In short, a GML file contains some <span class="highlight">global variables</span>, some <span class="highlight">locations</span> with their own variables and some <span class="highlight">items</span>
with their own variables, which all will be put and linked together by the interpreter to create a view like in an old adventure game (E.g. Monkey Island). Also, since v0.2.x, there is a
<span class="highlight">sound</span>-bank for playing sounds after a click on an item, and more.<br />
<br />
There are no visible user characters included yet but you can browse a GML page somewhat like in the game "Myst".<br />
<br />
Note that a GIML page runs on the client side. It does not need any PHP or NodeJS server stuff (right now) and no complex framework like Symfony is needed. Also, NO cookies are involved and no user login or other database stuff is needed on the core system.<br />
<br /><hr /><br />
It is only a coincidence that the name of this system resembles the name of the great dwarf Gimli from the Lord Of The Rings. But on the other side, there is no such thing as coincidence and so I believe the name is just right because Gimli visited Moria, which resembles the internet of modern times. And do not forget that the books were written at times were there was no computer networks, not even public computers.<br />
<br />
GIML[i] shall be the "new" internet, the one you see in like every movie where there is a computer,
from before the year 2000. After 2000, the "real internet" existed and movies resembled that one
instead of their own vision of an internet. So, what did you see there?
Mostly some 3D-animations of futuristic cities, or something, where the user can fly through.
I did not like that vision but it is more...creative than
the ad- and cookie-filled internet from today.<br />
<br />
Then I watched the TV-series "Halt And Catch Fire" which
you should watch, too. :) Its setting is in the 1980ties
until 1990ties. The first season is about building a new home computer. 
In the second and/or third season, they make a gaming community
and build their own internet. And then in S3E1, at about 11:30 + 30sec, that is the key scene. She walks her avatar into a new screen and says: "There we are. 64K pixels of new plain grounds, ready to be set up." (alike) Just watch it. :)<br />
<br />
And that is GIML[i]: 
It shall resemble the community system from "Halt And Catch Fire":<br />An Adventure-like, 2D, pixelated but very sweet
internet browsing system based on images, where the end-user [hopefully] can draw into like a child.<br />

<br /><hr />

<a name="interpreter"></a>
<h1>The GIML-Interpreter <a href="#top">^</a></h1>
For this particular interpreter here, you can just put all the files in any directory and run the <span class="highlight">interpreter/index.html</span>. All GIML stuff is in the <span class="highlight">testsite</span> folder inside the <span class="highlight">interpreter</span> folder.<br />
<br />
The GIML-page will be loaded with a function call in the index.html. Later, the browser itself shall do that. You can change the directory and page there. Keep in mind that this is just a prototype.<br />
<br />
Be aware that the testsite has some "faulty" (but working) entries and some errors. They were made to test if the interpreter can handle it.<br />
<br />
E.g.: There is the same file loaded in two gml files. 
It should give a warning that there is a double entry, despite the "different" paths from the two issuing files.<br />
<br />
The <span class="highlight">testsite</span> folder or any other folder with a GIML-page should reside OUTSIDE of the interpreter core directory. But because of CORS,
there are to much security measures to make such stuff happen "as is", without setting up complex server stuff and so on. I mean, I just want to edit a file and test it out locally.
I don't want to set up a whole server infrastructure just to see how a freaking "Markup Language"-file looks on the browser. Damn CORS. So, I just put the GIML-folders into the interpreter
folder. Sorry for that. No, not sorry: Damn and curse CORS for that. It made the internet a whole lot more complicated and I don't want to see it on "my" internet. <br />

<br /><hr />

The interpreter usually loads some values from a <span class="highlight">.gml</span>-file. It then uses the directory of this file as base directory and loads all the other images and stuff seen from there.<br />
<br />
Those commands and values are created as is, when they are needed or could be used, and no warrantries given. ;)<br />
<br />
The interpreter makes use of the JavaScript <a href="https://github.com/ben0bi/jBash">jBash console system</a> to call the functions from the GML-items. GIMLI uses jBashs command registering and issuing mechanism for its own needs. Maybe there will be another, own, parser later, which also takes care of the actual (issuing) item. Right now, only global commands can be issued. You can make use of command parameters, though.<br />
<br />
The scripts will NOT be loaded right now, you need to load and register them manually. Later there will be a script directory given in the gml file.<br />

<a name="direct_link"></a>
<h2>Direct Links</h2>
You can add a room name as key to your (HTML-)URL*. E.g.: <span class="highlight">.../index.html?my_room_1</span>. It just gets the first
parameter without value - the key is the value. The interpreter will then jump to this room (Here: <span class="highlight">my_room_1</span>) instead of 
the start room given in your GML-files. So, you can interlink to your desired room between different GIML-pages on different servers, or even between HTML and GIML pages.
It checks very primitive right now. ;)<br />
<br />
* As mentioned on other places, this is just a JavaScript-Prototype for the GIML-structure. You need to call <span class="highlight">index.html</span> in the <span class="highlight">interpreter</span>-directory
to get the interpreter "up and running". The GML-page will be loaded/called from inside the index.html until GIML has native browser support. You need to modify the path to your GML in the index.html right now, not "from outside" like in a "normal" URL call.
But you can change the room from "outside", that is what this chapter is about. Also, it does not work very well right now, because the loading process maybe "intercepts" the direct link call.

<a name="json_structure_1"></a>
<h2>It's plain JSON <a href="#gml_structure">^</a></h2>
GML files are written in the <span class="highlight">JSON format</span>, so they can be loaded by just anything and are human readable and easy to edit.<br />
<br />
The scripts for the items are written in <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span> which makes them compatible for all browsers. They will be loaded into the <span class="highlight">jBash</span>-command structure to be used with the items. See the built-in <span class="highlight">jump</span> (GIMLI) and <span class="highlight">link</span> (jBash) commands.<br />
<br />
All GIML command names will be converted to uppercase. All jBash commands will be converted to lowercase.

<a name="gml_global_values"></a>
<h2>Global Values <a href="#gml_structure">^</a></h2>
There are some global values you need to consider. Some values can be set with more than one name but only the primary one will be taken if both are present.<br />
<br />
Optional parameters have a default value.<br />
<br />

	not be visible, but the interpreter will take its size for the item size and check its pixels for collision on 
	mouseover. You do not have to determine one when the collision area is the same as the visible area of the main image.

<a name="gml_panels"></a>
<h2>Panels <a href="#gml_structure">^</a></h2>
The panels structure is there to display "raw" text with some buttons to decide from.<br />
You can use it for dialogues or just to show some "real" panel like the text on a road sign.
<br />
In the global <span class="highlight">PANELS</span>-array, you can create
as much panel entries as you want with the following parameters and values:<br />

I do not check for json bugs right now. If it does not work, look at the debugger. If it says "json is null" somewhere, your json is faulty. Check for commas. ;)<br />
<br />
First we set the start room. The start room is the one loaded with the last loaded gml file, where it is set. So if there is a start room in cellar.gml, it will take this one.<br />
<br />
Second there is a global scale factor which will be applied to all images. I use 2.0 to get some nice pixelated view.<br />
<br />
In the GMLs-Array, there are two file names. It will use the directory of this files (the second one) for loading stuff from that files.
So you can forget about the FOLDER tag, which you see everywhere below.<br />
<br />
As you can see, the items are both located in the start room, but the second one has no image. It will only check mouseover on the collision image without displaying anything.
The scripts of the items are jBash-commands with some parameters. The parameter "to" could be omitted. ;) The <span class="highlight">link</span> opens a new, external, "normal"
web page while the <span class="highlight">jump</span> loads another location from the same gml file.<br />
<br />
{You won't get out of the second room with this file. There needs to be another door... ;) }<br />
<br />
The first item plays the loaded sound when it is clicked. It will wait for the sound to finish before it executes the scripted link. Whereelse, the sound would not play because the external page
would be loaded instantly and overwrite the actual GIMLI-framework and thus the sound engine.<br />

<h1>Scripting with GIML <a href="#top">^</a></h1></h1>
<span class="highlight">(TODO)</span> Short: Just make a javascript function with one parameter, add it to jBash and call the jBash-command for it in the "SCRIPT" tag of your item. Only global functions just right now.
jBash commands can have several parameters separated by space. All parameters are given as a whole string to your function.<br />
<br />
Those are the predefined commands exclusively made for GML, where Secondary is the same command in another word:<br />

<a name="about"></a>
<h1>About the Author <a href="#top">^</a></h1></h1>
<span class="highlight">GIML[i]</span> - and prior to that <a href="https://github.com/ben0bi/jBash">jBash</a> - were invented by <span class="highlight">Benedict Jäggi</span> a.k.a. <span class="highlight">oki wan benobi</span> in the year 19amb (Anno Millenium Bug).
Benedict visited the <a href="https://www.games-academy.de/">Games Academy</a> in Berlin between 2006 (6amb) to 2008 (8amb) and made a degree in <span class="highlight">3D Programming</span> and <span class="highlight">Game Design</span>. But instead of working in the games industry, he decided to go back to his birth place and try to "make it" from there.<br />
<br />
He grew up with computers and used the browser based internet since it was thrown into the world in 1995. He learned to program and use much types of programming languages and computers. Starting with BASICa on the Atari, then on DOS, he advanced to C and C++ and a very very little of Assembler. Then the internet showed up ;) and he learned Java, JavaScript, C# and besides that the web stuff (HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL) and with the Games Academy also all sorts and types of game engines, including the Half-Life 2 engine, the Unity Engine and the Unreal Engine, and as hobbyist also all sorts of mobile devices like the Nintendo Gameboy, Android devices, Nintendo NDS and other stuff. Also he learned to program and assemble Arduino based devices and in the latter he makes very much stuff with Raspberry Pi(e)s. He can say from himself that he can program on almost every device. Maybe not with the best code but...on every device. =)
